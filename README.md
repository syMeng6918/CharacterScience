This repository contains code used for the Newcomers' Assignment in the Intelligent Media Processing Lab.  
The task is to train a binary classifier to detect whether a font matches a specific impression tag (e.g., "decorative", "condense").

## Main Files

- `train_multimgv4.py`: Main training script. Supports command-line arguments such as model type, loss function, target tag, and number of letters.
- `preprocess_data_reference.py`: Revised version of the original preprocessing script, modified to be compatible with updated libraries.
- `dataset.py`: Dataset class for **single-character** input training.
- `dataset_repeat.py`: Dataset class for **multi-character** input. Supports dynamic repetition (i.e., synthesizing multiple samples per font per epoch).

## Folder

- `dataset/`: Contains:
  - Preprocessed training images  
  - CSV files for font-tag mappings  
  - A frequency statistics file used to decide which tags are worth testing


## How to start training
- python train_multimgv4.py --tag decorative --model efficientnet --loss asl --letters 4 --repeat 4 --epochs 60
- You can change the tag to others like condense, animate, etc., via the --tag argument.
- ðŸ’¡ If the dataset is highly imbalanced, you can adjust the gamma_neg parameter in the ASL loss function (e.g., set gamma_neg=1.5) to improve robustness against dominant negative samples.

## Environment
- A Dockerfile for fully reproducible setup is being planned.
